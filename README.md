# 🏠 Predictive Analysis of Sydney House Prices 🏙️

## 🌆 Project Overview
This project is centered around predicting Sydney house prices using a variety of machine-learning models. The dataset, which spans from 2000 to 2019, encompasses roughly 200,000 property sales in Sydney as obtained from realestate.com.au. Through detailed exploration and preprocessing of this dataset, our aim has been to achieve the highest accuracy in our predictions across multiple machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset, an analytical cornerstone of this project, presents property sale records from Sydney over a duration of 19 years (2000-2019). It provides insights into nearly 200,000 property sales transactions. Each record delineates attributes that are potential influencers of a property's price, including:

- 📅 Sale date
- 📍 Location (both suburb and postal code)
- 🏡 Property type
- 🛏️ Key features of the property (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces)

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal was to predict housing prices in Sydney over the span of two decades. This involved deciphering significant determinants of house prices and gauging the performance of various predictive models in capturing these determinants and trends.

## ✅ Key Tasks Undertaken
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies present in the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized and analyzed distributions, correlations, and patterns within the data.
- 🔧 **Feature Engineering:** Enhanced the dataset by deriving new features and optimizing existing ones to boost model performance.
- 🤖 **Model Selection and Training:** Various predictive models, including Linear Regression, KNN, and Random Forest, were selected, trained, and evaluated based on their predictive accuracy.
- 🎛️ **Model Tuning:** Used techniques like grid search and cross-validation to fine-tune model parameters, enhancing prediction capabilities.
- ⚖️ **Evaluation:** Employed metrics like MAE, R2 score, and scatter plots to evaluate and compare the performance of each model.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- 🌍 Location remained a paramount determinant in Sydney's housing market, reaffirming the real estate principle of "location, location, location".
- 📉 Decade-spanning fluctuations possibly reflect external events (be it economic, political, or environmental), highlighting the housing market's inherent dynamism.
- 🌲 Among evaluated models, ensemble methods, notably the Tuned Random Forest, emerged as the most adept in making accurate predictions.

## 📉 Visualization and Comparative Analysis
Scatter plots offered an intuitive glimpse into the predictive prowess of different models. The predictions from the Tuned Random Forest, in particular, aligned closely with actual prices, signifying its superior capability in the context of Sydney's housing scene.

## 🌟 Future Recommendations
- 📆 **Time-Series Analysis:** Delve into the temporal aspects of housing prices to identify underlying seasonality, trends, and cyclical patterns.
- 📈 **Integrate External Factors:** Incorporate datasets like economic indicators or population metrics to enrich predictive accuracy.
- 🗺️ **Geospatial Analysis:** Harnessing Sydney's geographical data might yield deeper insights into price variations across regions.

## 🖊️ Conclusion
The complexity of Sydney's housing market, with its diverse influences and factors, posed a challenge ripe for prediction. Our progression from foundational models like Linear Regression to sophisticated ones like the Tuned Random Forest showcased the transformative potential of predictive analytics in real estate.
